# CrankFi Whitepaper

## Introduction
CrankFi is a **move-to-earn platform for cyclists**.  
Our mission is to incentivize people around the world to ride more, stay healthy, and build sustainable communities powered by Web3.

Unlike walking-based M2E projects (e.g., StepN), CrankFi focuses on **cycling**, using **power meters, pedals, and integrations with Strava/Komoot** to track real performance and convert effort into rewards.

---

## Problem
- Current M2E apps focus on walking/running but leave out millions of cyclists.
- Fitness apps (Strava, Komoot) offer tracking and community but no financial incentives.
- Crypto + sport projects often fail due to poor tokenomics and lack of utility beyond speculation.

---

## Solution
CrankFi combines **fitness tracking, token rewards, and social cycling features**:
- Integration with Strava/Komoot for smooth onboarding.
- CrankFi App (iOS/Android) with built-in ride tracking, route planning, and group rides.
- Rewards in the form of the native token **CRANK**.
- NFT-based equipment (virtual pedals, cranksets, bikes) that increase reward efficiency.
- Community features: share routes, form teams, and compete in seasonal challenges.

---

## Tokenomics
**Token Name:** CRANK  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 CRANK  

### Utility of CRANK:
- Rewards for completed rides.
- Upgrades and maintenance of NFT equipment.
- Entry to competitions, challenges, and events.
- Marketplace currency (routes, gear, coaching sessions).

### Reward Logic:
- Base rewards scale with ride effort (watts, distance, elevation gain).
- Anti-cheating: GPS + power meter verification.
- Daily reward cap to prevent abuse.

---

## NFTs
- Virtual **Crank NFT** is the core item required to start earning.
- Additional NFTs: pedals, wheels, bikes.
- NFTs can be upgraded or traded on marketplace.
- Higher rarity = higher efficiency multiplier.

---

## Partnerships
- **Hardware:** pedal & power meter manufacturers (Garmin, Wahoo, SRM).
- **Apps:** Strava, Komoot, TrainingPeaks integrations.
- **Events:** cycling marathons, local clubs, esport races.

---

## Roadmap
**Q4 2025** — MVP launch: basic ride tracking + CRANK testnet rewards.  
**Q1 2026** — NFT marketplace beta, first hardware partnerships.  
**Q2 2026** — Strava/Komoot integration, mobile app public release.  
**Q3 2026** — Global cycling events + community challenges.  
**Q4 2026** — DAO governance, CrankFi expansion beyond cycling (triathlon, rowing).

---

## KPIs
- **User growth:** 100k cyclists in first year.  
- **Active rides tracked:** 1M rides in first 12 months.  
- **Token adoption:** 30% of users actively using CRANK for upgrades/marketplace.  

---

## Conclusion
CrankFi is the first dedicated move-to-earn platform for cyclists, combining the passion for cycling with Web3 incentives.  
By leveraging real hardware integrations, gamification, and tokenomics, CrankFi creates a sustainable ecosystem where **every ride counts**.
